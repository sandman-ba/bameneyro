    <section class="about-me">
        <p>
            I was born in Mexico and moved to the US in 2019 to pursue a PhD in mathematics at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
            My love for solving puzzles pushed me towards science, and my tendency to tinker with everything to understand how things work made me choose mathematics and computers.
            I'm also a very active person, I like volleyball and martial arts, as well as outdoors activities like hiking, climbing and camping.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current research interests encompass the applications of artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning and quantum computing to biology, ecology and medicine.
            In the past I have worked with stochastic and ODE models for infectious diseases.
            My personal interests include the development of free and open source software as well as scientific outreach.
